Hi! My name is Meiling Tang, and I’ve recently started exploring the world of Gong Fu Cha—the traditional Chinese art of tea. I’m still at the beginning of my journey, learning little by little with each brew, but I’ve already fallen in love with the calm, the rituals, and the flavors. I’m starting this blog to share what I’m discovering, and hopefully connect with others who are just as curious (or way more experienced!) so we can learn and sip together.
